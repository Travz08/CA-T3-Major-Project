## Retrospect

Retrospect is a full stack application powered by NodeJS and React that allows Teachers to organize their resources for students. Retrospect is designed so that every day the teacher inputs a log that contains the following;
- Summary of the Day's Lesson.
- Coding Challenge of the Day.
- Resources that were used that day.

The student has full access to these notes and logs into the application via their gmail account provided by Coder Academy. After logging in, the Student joins the classroom where they can view the log posted by the teacher.
